# ðŸš€ Space Shooter Game

This is a simple 2D space shooter game created using **Python** and the **Pygame** library.  
The game was built by following a tutorial on YouTube to learn the basics of game development with Pygame.

## ðŸŽ® Game Description

In this game, you control a spaceship that can:

- Move **up**, **down**, and **side to side**
- **Shoot lasers** by pressing the **spacebar**

Your goal is to survive as long as possible while avoiding falling meteors.  
The longer you survive, the higher your **score**.  
Note: Destroying meteors with your laser **does not** increase your score â€” survival time is what counts!

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Pygame-based 2D gameplay
- Spaceship movement in all directions
- Laser shooting using the **spacebar**
- Randomly falling meteors as obstacles
- Score based on survival time
- Constant meteor speed (does not increase over time)
